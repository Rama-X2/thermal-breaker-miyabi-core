# 🌸 Thermal Breaker Miyabi Core

**Thermal Breaker Miyabi Core** is a performance-oriented Magisk module engineered to intelligently refine Android thermal policies and reduce overly aggressive throttling — without disabling essential hardware-level protection mechanisms.

Unlike extreme “thermal disabler” tweaks, this module focuses on **balancing performance and safety**, ensuring your device maintains stable sustained performance under load while preserving long-term hardware integrity.

---

## 🧠 Philosophy

Modern Android devices often apply conservative thermal limits that trigger early throttling.
While this protects hardware, it can also significantly reduce sustained performance during:

* Gaming
* Heavy multitasking
* Long recording sessions
* Video rendering
* Benchmark stress testing

Thermal Breaker Miyabi Core does **not remove thermal protection**.
Instead, it **refines and restructures thermal profiles** to allow more intelligent and performance-aware scaling.

## 🎯 Target Environment

Optimized and tested primarily for:

* 📱 Xiaomi devices (MIUI & Custom ROM)
* 🧬 SuperiorOS Android 11–13
* ⚙ MediaTek & Snapdragon platforms

Other devices may work, but compatibility is not guaranteed.

Results may vary depending on:

* Kernel implementation
* Vendor thermal framework
* ROM-level thermal modifications

## 📊 Performance Expectations

After installation, you may notice:

* More stable FPS during gaming
* Reduced sudden CPU/GPU frequency drops
* Smoother long-session performance
* Less aggressive mid-load throttling

⚠ This is **not a benchmark booster module**.
It is designed for **real-world sustained performance balance**.

## 🧩 Compatibility Notes

* Works best on stock thermal frameworks
* Not recommended to stack with other thermal-disabling modules
* Avoid combining with extreme performance mods unless tested carefully

If instability occurs:

* Disable other thermal-related modules
* Reboot
* Test again

## ⚠ Disclaimer

This module modifies system thermal configuration behavior but **does NOT disable hardware-level thermal protection systems**.

However:

* Overclocking
* Poor ventilation
* Extreme gaming in high ambient temperatures

may still cause overheating.
